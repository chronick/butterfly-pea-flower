# Butterfly Pea Flower pH Indicator Experiment

**Grade Level:** Elementary School (K-5)
**Time:** 30 minutes
**Group Size:** Whole class or small groups

---

## The Big Idea

Butterfly pea flowers make a special blue tea that changes color like magic! When you add something **sour** (an acid), it turns **pink**. When you add something **slippery-feeling** (a base), it turns **green**. This teaches us about acids, bases, and how scientists test liquids!

## Background for Teachers

### What is pH?
pH is a scale from 0-14 that measures how acidic or basic a substance is:
- **0-6** = Acidic (sour things like lemon juice, vinegar)
- **7** = Neutral (plain water)
- **8-14** = Basic/Alkaline (slippery things like soap, baking soda)

### What is an Indicator?
An indicator changes color to show if something is an acid or base. Butterfly pea flowers contain **anthocyanin**, a natural blue pigment that changes color at different pH levels.

### Why Butterfly Pea Flowers?
- Safer and easier than red cabbage juice
- Non-toxic and taste-safe for young children
- Dramatic, vivid color changes
- Quick to prepare (just steep in hot water)

> **From the Garden:** Can't find butterfly pea flowers? No problem! Blueberries, blackberries, beets, and rose petals all contain anthocyanins and work as pH indicators too. Blend and strain, or simmer in water to extract the color. A great way to use overripe produce!

## Materials

### For the Indicator Solution
- 1 tablespoon dried butterfly pea flowers (or 2 tea bags)
- 2 cups hot water

### For Testing
| Cup | Label | Test Solution |
|-----|-------|---------------|
| 1 | "Blue Tea Only" | Nothing (control) |
| 2 | "Water" | Plain water (control) |
| 3 | "Lemon Juice" | Fresh squeezed lemon |
| 4 | "Baking Soda" | 1 tsp baking soda + ¼ cup water |

### Equipment
- 4 clear cups or jars
- Measuring cups and spoons
- Spoons for stirring
- Labels or marker
- White paper (to place behind cups for better visibility)

## Procedure

### Part 1: Make the Indicator (Teacher Prep)

1. Pour 2 cups of **hot water** into a heat-safe container
2. Add dried butterfly pea flowers or tea bags
3. Steep for **5 minutes** until deep blue
4. Remove flowers and let cool for **10 minutes**

⚠️ **Safety:** Adults handle hot water!

### Part 2: Set Up the Experiment

1. Label four clear cups
2. Pour ¼ cup of blue indicator into each cup
3. Place white paper behind cups

### Part 3: Test and Observe

**Before each test, ask students:** *"What do you think will happen?"*

| Step | Add This | Expected Result |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| Cup 1 | Nothing | Stays **BLUE** |
| Cup 2 | 1 tbsp plain water | Stays **BLUE** (neutral) |
| Cup 3 | 1 tbsp lemon juice | Turns **PINK/PURPLE** (acid!) |
| Cup 4 | 1 tbsp baking soda solution | Turns **GREEN** (base!) |

## Results Chart

| Cup | What We Added | Type | pH | Color |
|-----|---------------|------|-----|-------|
| 1 | Nothing | Control | ~7 | 🔵 Blue |
| 2 | Water | Neutral | 7 | 🔵 Blue |
| 3 | Lemon Juice | Acid | ~2 | 🩷 Pink |
| 4 | Baking Soda | Base | ~8 | 💚 Green |

## Bonus: The Reversible Reaction!

This is the "wow" moment:

1. Take Cup 3 (the pink lemon juice cup)
2. Slowly add baking soda solution, a little at a time
3. Watch the color change: **Pink → Purple → Blue → Green**

**What's happening?** The base (baking soda) is *neutralizing* the acid (lemon juice). This is called a **neutralization reaction**!

---

## Discussion Questions

1. **Why did lemon juice turn the tea pink?**
   → Because lemon juice is an ACID (it's sour!)

2. **Why did baking soda turn the tea green?**
   → Because baking soda is a BASE (opposite of acid)

3. **Why didn't water change the color?**
   → Because water is NEUTRAL (not acid, not base)

4. **What other sour things might be acids?**
   → Vinegar, orange juice, soda, tomatoes

5. **What other slippery things might be bases?**
   → Soap, toothpaste, egg whites

## Key Vocabulary

| Term | Kid-Friendly Definition |
|------|------------------------|
| **Acid** | A substance that tastes sour and turns our tea PINK |
| **Base** | A substance that feels slippery and turns our tea GREEN |
| **pH** | A number that tells us how sour or slippery something is |
| **Indicator** | Something that changes color to show acid or base |
| **Neutral** | Not sour, not slippery – right in the middle (like water) |
| **Anthocyanin** | The special blue color in butterfly pea flowers |

## Safety Notes

✅ All materials are **non-toxic** and safe for children
✅ Safe for ages 3+ with adult supervision
✅ Adults should handle hot water
⚠️ Do not drink solutions after adding baking soda
✅ Wash hands after experiment

## Where to Buy Butterfly Pea Flowers

- Asian grocery stores
- Amazon (search "dried butterfly pea flowers")
- Health food stores
- Tea specialty shops

💡 **Tip:** A small bag (~1 oz) is enough for 10+ experiments!

## Extension Activities

1. **Test more household items:** Orange juice, milk, soapy water, sprite
2. **Make a pH rainbow:** Create cups at different pH levels
3. **Color-changing lemonade:** Make drinkable lemonade that changes when you add lemon!
4. **Art project:** Use the indicator as watercolor paint on paper treated with lemon juice or baking soda
